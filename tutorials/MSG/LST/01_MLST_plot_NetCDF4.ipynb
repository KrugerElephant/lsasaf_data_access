    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a simple example of opening and plotting the LSA SAF Meteosat Land Surface Temperature ([MLST](https://lsa-saf.eumetsat.int/en/data/products/land-surface-temperature-and-emissivity/)) product with `python` is presented. The LSA SAF products are available as NetCDF4 files. MLST is a LSA SAF product that estimates Land Surface Temperature (LST) based on measurements with the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) on board of Meteosat second generation (MSG) satellite. The spatial resolution of SEVIRI measurements is 3 $\\times$ 3 km directly under the satellite, while it increases towards the edge of the Earth disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimates of MLST are calculated using top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature at 10.8 $\\mu m$ and 12.0 $\\mu m$ bands. The methodology is based on a generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm. A detailed description is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JD010035). The MLST product is only available over land and not over the waters."
